Appointment Policies: Please bring your materials (textbook, notes, laptop,=
 writing utensils, etc.) with you to your appointment. We do not assist stu=

Our Cancellation Policy States:
1. Students who are more than 10 minutes late or leave more than 10 minutes=
 early will receive a No Show occurrence.

2. Appointments must be cancelled at least 24 hours prior to original time =
to avoid a No Show occurrence. If the student cancels within 24 hours of th=
e original time (regardless of reasoning) the student will receive a No Sho=
w occurrence.

3. Upon receiving two No Shows, scheduling privileges will be suspended. St=
udents will need to meet with a Learning Commons professional staff member =
to discuss improved strategies for time management and using Learning Commo=
ns resources. After this meeting, scheduling privileges will be reopened.

4. Upon receiving three No Shows within one semester, scheduling privileges=
 for all Learning Commons appointment-based services will be revoked for th=
e remainder of that term. This is applied to all services within the Learni=
ng Commons, including the Academic Writing Center.

5. If students need to cancel more than 24 hours prior to the scheduled tim=
e, they may do so in TutorTrac. If the cancellation is within 24 hours, stu=
dents cannot cancel in TutorTrac but must contact the front desk staff.


Thank you,
